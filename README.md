# OOP JS

1. Simplest way to bundle data => [object]

## ways to create objects:
1. object literal:
<script>
    const object = {
        name: 'foo',
        age: 36,
        talk(){
            console.log('Hello');
        }
    };
</script>

2.  dot notation:
<script>
    const object2 = {};

    object2.name = 'Adrian';
    object2.age = 20;
    object2.talk = function(){ console.log('Hello');}
</script>

3. Object.create => built in method

`Too much DRY`

4. Function to create objects => untenable => you cant waste memory creating a copy of a method for every single object you generate.

## Prototype Chain:

- How does the new keyword works under the hood? 

**Object.create()** => *hidden bond*. => [__proto__] => `make a link => hidden bond.`
- Js prototypeal nature. => not give up inmediatly when you dont find somthing in the object encapsulation.

## new & this KEYWORD:
new keyword it's exactly the same as Object.create().
`First you need to unserstand that functions in js are function and also objects`

## SCOPE & THIS:
1. 1 simple rule => when I called a function with a this keyword => I always got to assume that the [this] refers to the left had-side of the .
<script>
    //code 
    function increment(){
        this.score++
    }
    user20.increment // this is refering to user20
</script>

### Arrow functions solve the this issues: 
<script>
    function UserCreator(name, score){
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
};

UserCreator.prototype.increment = function(){
    const addOne = () => {
        this.score += 1;
    }
    addOne();
};

UserCreator.prototype.login = function(){
   console.log(this.name + ' has logged in')
};
</script>

## CLASS: 
**Class => it's bascically syntactic sugar** => the only difference with the last approach is that it will save you the functions in the *object.prototype* for you. It will do it implicitly for you but its actually the same thing.
 Its alkmost similar to a **Constructur function** => but tyrully is more readable.

 <script>
    // CLASS IMPLEMENTATION:
class UserCreator2 {
    constructor (name, score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    } // this here is actually more like a "autogenerated object"
    increment(){
        this.score++
    }
    decrement(){
        this.score--
    }
}

user30 = new UserCreator2('Philipe', 78)
user30.increment()
console.log(user30)
 </script>
